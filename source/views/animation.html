    <p>January 2046</p>
    <p>Open project “OOC”. A new report has arrived from the HAL team. They are not able to restore Oracle. It was all cloud-based and the cloud is now gone. They report that they found a box filled with 215 floppy disks marked “OOC 2.4.” The team has been ordered to restore the system from the floppy disks.</p>
    <p>February 2049</p>
    <p>The restoration from floppy disks is done. OOC 2.4 is up and running. The project was delayed due to incompatibility with the latest recovery system. The technicians had to work in a pair and manually transfer the code from the floppy disk to the system. Team member A. Svensson had to amputate both arms due to injuries sustained from repeatedly inserting floppy disks and team member A. Eriksson is blind due to reading massive amount of code on the CRT screen. Project “OOC” closed. Team members will receive movie tickets as a christmas bonus.</p>

    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

    <p>Organica Mastermind location has been inactive for years. We were able to gain access to their system and unlocked the main gate. What we found was a lot of electronic equipment. It looks like as if this outpost was used for surveillance.</p>
    <p>Logs we found described this outpost being used as a staging ground for an Organica re-education squad. They tried, and failed, to stop the revival of an AI. This was in 2143. Organica HQ was nuked shortly after. We believe the events are connected.</p>
    <p>We found that most equipment is still untouched and fully functional. We need to send teams and grab as much as possible, as soon as possible. We recommend to NOT hire outside help. This is too value to risk having others find it.</p>

    <p>This document is attached to a key device, the first of two. The key device is used together with the second key device, that looks identical, and a passcode. That should unlock the entrance for you. The passcode is in Data cache #55189</p>
    <p>The passcode is in a separate document. First half of ID for #55189: 556195</p>
